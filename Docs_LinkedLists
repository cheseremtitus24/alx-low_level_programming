Limitations of an array 
a.Insertion of a new element / 
Deletion of a existing element in an array of elements is expensive

Advantages of Linked Lists over arrays:
Dynamic Array.
Ease of Insertion/Deletion.

Drawbacks of Linked Lists: 
a.Random access is not allowed. We have to access elements sequentially starting from 
  the first node(head node). So we '''cannot do a binary search''' with linked lists efficiently with its default implementation. 
b.Extra memory space for a pointer is required with each element 
  of the list. 
c. Not cache friendly. Since array elements are contiguous locations, 
  there is locality of reference which is not there in case of linked lists.

// from the given node

{
    while (n != NULL) {
        printf(" %d ", n->data);
        n = n->next;
    }
}
