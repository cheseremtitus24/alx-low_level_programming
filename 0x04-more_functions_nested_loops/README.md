1-isdigit.c - checks for digit characters and prints 1 if there's a match else 0
2-mul.c - prints the multiplication to of two integers.
3-print_numbers.c - outputs integers from 0 - 9  
4-print_most_numbers.c - outputs integers from 0 - 9 except for digits 2 and 4
5-more_numbers.c - outputs digits from 0-14 within 10 consecutive rows.
6-print_line.c  - outputs a line based on the input integer length
7-print_diagonal.c - outputs a diagonal based on the integer length provided.
8-print_square.c - outputs a square of integer defined length.
9-fizz_buzz.c - outputs digits from 1-100 with the numbers divisible by 3,5 & [3,5] being replaced by Fizz , Buzz and FizzBuzz respectively.
