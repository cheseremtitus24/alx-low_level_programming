# Concepts 
1. C language while and for loops

0-putchar.c - outputs the string _putchar

1-alphabet.c - outputs lowercase alphabets from a-z

2-print_alphabet_x10.c - prints lowercase alphabets 10 times with each series in its own line

3-islower.c - checks if a character is lowercase and outputs 1 else 0

4-isalpha.c - prints 1 if a character is an alphabet else 0

5-sign.c - checks for positive , negative and neutral numbers and output 1 -1 or 0 and + 0 and - respectively.

6-abs.c - outputs the absolute value of an integer.

7-print_last_digit.c - outputs the last digit of a number.

8-24_hours.c - ouputs a time counter of minutes and seconds from 00:00 to 23:59.

9-times_table.c - outputs the multiplication table of 9 starting from 0x9 to 9x9

10-add.c - Outputs the sum of two numbers.

11-print_to_98.c - outputs counters incrementally or decrementally to 98 based on the starting number.
