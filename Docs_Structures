Pointers to structures

to access a pointer to a structure, you have to dereference the pointer
and then access its data using the '.' symbol.

BUT
There is a simple way to do that, just by
using the ‘->’ symbol.
This symbol is equivalent to dereferencing
+ using '.'

#include <stdio.h>
struct User
{
  char *name, *email;
  int age;
 }
  int main(void)
  {
    struct User user;
    struct User *ptr;
    
    ptr = &user;
    /* Dereferencing the pointer before accessing the data with the '.' symbol */
    (*ptr).name = "foo";
    
    /* Using the '->' works the same, and is much easier */
    ptr->email = "foo@email.com";
    
    return(0);
   }
